    "This is a BIG update!",
    "A bug was fixed that caused the IPA files to not be selectable in File Picker. This was because of ESIGN / Gbox and other such signers messing up the entitlements of iDevice ToolKit when signing. Proper signing tools like Sideloadly, AltStore, etc. worked fine.",
    "The issue has been fixed through a workaround in iDevice ToolKit, so it should work now, but the bug in ESIGN, etc. not copying the entitlements properly remains and should be addressed by those developers.",
    "You can now inject real iOS Jailbreak tweaks (DYLIB / Framework) into IPA applications. Just specify the IPA file and the tweak, and the tool will combine them and give you an IPA you can either sign with AltStore / Sideloadly / ESIGN, etc., or install via TrollStore (where available). This module works on iOS 16.0 - iOS 18.5 on all devices. Use responsibly. iDevice Central never has and never will condone piracy!",
    "Fixed some UI bugs."
